# Python-SQL-Data_Analysis_project
This project focuses on a full data analysis pipeline using Python and SQL. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive visualizations in Tableau. The goal is to derive actionable insights from raw data, ensuring clear and data-driven decisions.

##Overview
This project implements a complete data analysis workflow using Python and SQL. It uses Python and SQL to clean and analyze data. Then, Tableau visualizations reveal key insights.

## Key Features
-Data Cleaning and preprocessing using Python (e.g., pandas, numpy).
-SQL queries for extracting and transforming data from databases.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
-Interactive dashboards and visualizations created with Tableau.

## Skills utilized
-Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlin, etc.)
-SQL (quering and transforming data)
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Tableau (visualization and dashboards)


##Desription
Leveraging Python and SQL, this project cleans raw data, performs in-depth exploratory analysis, and then presents key findings through visualizations.


## How to Use
1. Load the raw data files or connect to your database.
2. Run the Python scripts for data cleaning and transformation.
3. Execute SQL querines to extract and prepare the dataset.
4. Use the Tableau dashboards to explore and visualize insights.
